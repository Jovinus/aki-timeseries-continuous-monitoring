# Deep Learning Models for Acute Kidney Injury Prediction

**Deep Learning Models for Acute Kidney Injury Prediction: Multi-Center External Validation and Evaluation Under Simulated Continuous Monitoring Conditions**

This repository contains the code for training, evaluating, and analyzing deep learning and machine learning models for Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) prediction using electronic health record (EHR) time-series data. The models are developed on a single-center dataset and externally validated across three hospitals. A key contribution is the **simulated continuous monitoring (online simulation)** framework that evaluates model performance under realistic deployment conditions, where predictions are generated continuously as new data arrives.

## Models

| Model | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Masked CNN** | Deep Learning | 1D CNN with RMSNorm and masked operations for variable-length sequences |
| **LSTM-Attention** | Deep Learning | LSTM encoder with attention mechanism |
| **ITE Transformer** | Deep Learning | Interpolation-Temporal Encoding Transformer for irregular time-series |
| **XGBoost** | ML Baseline | Gradient boosting on flattened time-series features |
| **Logistic Regression** | ML Baseline | L2-regularized logistic regression on flattened features |

## Datasets

- **NHIS Ilsan Hospital** (Internal development & test)
- **Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital (CSHH)** (External validation)
- **MIMIC-IV** (External validation)
